	abstract = {Emerald is an object-based language for the construction of distributed applications. The principal features of Emerald include a uniform object model appropriate for programming both private local objects and shared remote objects, and a type system that permits multiple user-defined and compiler-defined implementations. Emerald objects are fully mobile and can move from node to node within the network, even during an invocation. This paper discusses the structure, programming, and implementation of Emerald objects, and Emerald's use of abstract types.},
