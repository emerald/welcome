Emerald Tools
============

The bin directory contains a fair number of tools, and the architecture 
specific subdirectories contain a few more. Here's a quick reference to 
them: 


Architecture specific tools (found in bin/$arch)
-----------------------------------------------

emx          - emerald interpreter, built in vm/$arch, linked to bin
emyacc       - emerald emitting version of yacc
issymlink    - script to determine if a directory entry is a symbolic
	       link, used in Makefiles
vmc          - virtual machine compiler


Architecture independent tools
-----------------------------

user tools
---------
emc          - stable Emerald compiler
xemc         - experimental Emerald compiler
emmake       - Emerald specific make, includes appropriate architecture
	       specific and independent definitions expected by
	       Makefiles within the Emerald source tree
forallarch   - script to build architecture specific components on all
	       supported Emerald architectures
newarch      - script to create support for a new architecture
setarch      - script to set emerald architecture, used by emarch alias
setuser      - script to set emerald user, used by emuser alias
useemerald   - script to setup things for a new user


version control
--------------
findversion       - scripts to support maintaing backup versions
latestversion       of Emerald compiler and (soon) builtins
lsv, lsversion
newv, newversion
odversion
oldversion
regression
rev, reversion
rmv, rmversion
usev, useversion
whichv, whichversion

other tools (not for user use)
----------
issymlink-ls      - one of these is linked into each
issymlink-testh     bin/$arch directory, as appropriate for
issymlink-testl     the Unix flavour run on that architecture
