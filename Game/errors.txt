(locate foo) does not fail when foo is gone, but hangs>

^Z does not fail, but hangs

Will vectors automatically start off initialized to Nil?

added concurrency to bags

problems if allPlayerBag becomes inconsistent

what's attached?  means that the object moves with the parent

what's a condition for?  to wait and signal

think about changing getPriority to return a random priority if 
enough ticks have passed

watch out for daylight savings time!

high speed limitations

random thing doesn't quite work

non export class operations can't be called from within sub objects

newRoomServer uses priorities, not roomTick

add update player when we inform them of us...

ask about applications

remove from server if we're getting strange room ticks

seg faults might have been due to not enough myxf.flushes

removePlayerFromRoom also requires the name to be in dataString
so that it can remove the corresponding playerInfo entry

moveToRoom fills with newRoomID, goalX, goalY, currentX, currentY, playerName
